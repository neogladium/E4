  Mac OS X 1.5 (Aqua) by DeeLight
 ________________________________________

  Description:
     After doing my Winamp X skin, I wanted to do
     one that looked even more like the Mac OS X
     Aqua style. So I did Mac OS X, it looked a lot
     closer to the Aqua interface, but still wasn't like
     I wanted it to be. After Apple released Jaguar,
     I started work on this skin, on which I resumed
     work a few months later. Now, it's ready to be
     used, and I hope you like it as much as I do.

     Winamp 2.x has a lot of limitations, so I also
     plan to port this skin to Winamp 3, but keeping
     the classic winamp 2.x style, so stay tuned ;)

  Notes:
     I think that the songtitle font is better than in
     Mac OS X, but I'm still not completely satisfied.
     If you saw or made a font yourself that you
     think would fit perfectly, please le me know.
